<p>In my eyes a hero is someone that can bring value to your life. A hero is someone who can inspire you to be your best, and personally Tiger Woods is that for me.</p>

<p>A hero who inspires me would have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ambition - People with great ambition alwasys carry a go-getter attitude</li>
  <li>Strength of core values - Someone who believes in their core values and presents themselves in this manner</li>
  <li>Never settling - A person who knows that there is always something more to learn in life</li>
  <li>Loyal - Heroes have amplitudes of loyalty with the people they care about in life</li>
</ul>

<p>After giving some thought of who exemplifies these characterisitcs, Tiger Woods came to mind. I am inspired by the person he is when golfing, not in his daily life.
His attidue on the course and ambition to be the best player makes him stand out, and his attributes when golfing are very admirable and inspirational to me.</p>
