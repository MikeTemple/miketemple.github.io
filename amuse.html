<h1>Websites to make you laugh</h1>
<h4>by Mike Temple</h4>

  <p>For most of my online entertainment I use Tik Tok or Instagram. Sometimes these apps bring me to some websites that have funny facts or comments.</p>
  <p>The list below shows my top three websites that I have visited, and would like to share</p>

<h2>World Memes</h2>
  <p>This website is very funny. It has some memes around the world, and I'm pretty sure that everyone loves a good meme. I first found this website from
    a friend that showed it to me through instagram. For some funny memes I typically go to this site to send good ones to friends and family. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Short Jokes</h2>
  <p>For my next hilarious website, I chose to share a site that tells funny jokes. Some of the jokes are boring, but further scrolling can give some good
    laughs. I found this page just browsing Google for funny jokes to tell and stumbled across this page. Whenever I need to find a joke for a family
    function I typically end up looking here. Have a good laugh!</p>

<h2>Cyanide and Happiness</h2>
  <p>When I was a kid I really had fun watching all the Cyanide and Happiness videos. This website has some of those videos along with short comic strips
    of these characters. Some of the humor is crude, but each one does not fail to make a person laugh. Have fun watching these videos and scripts!</p>
